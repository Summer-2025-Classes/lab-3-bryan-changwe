Lab 3: Write a main program and subroutine in PIC18F assembly language

Due Date: July 3rd, 2025

Objective:
- Write a main program and a subroutine in PIC18F assembly language.
- Assemble and debug the main program and the subroutine using
  Microchip's MPLAB assembler/debugger.
- Demonstrate using the MPLAB how the hardware stack pointer (STKPTR)
  changes with the execution of the PIC18F CALL and RETURN
  instructions.
